First of all, new media art is a huge category. According to the topic, it
classified into a category of contemporary art. According to this concept, new media
art refers to those artistic works that focus on using modern technology and new
media to express the theme of works. Digital art (computer graphics), (virtual art),
(Internet art) (interactive art), (video games)( computer robotics) (3D printing), (art as
biotechnology). Each category listed here can discuss as an independent topic, but
many of the works in these branches can cross boundaries or cover several types. In
a broader sense, new media art can be classified as a Digital Art, namely Digital Art.
Alternatively, by another current definition, they are mostly Time-Based Media Art,
where Time becomes an important part of the composition of the work.
Ryoji Ikeda, are the representative of Audiovisual art, another branch of new
media art. Let us talk about Audiovisual first. Audiovisual can also classify as sound
art. It means sound visualization. Audiovisual art's works explore the infinite
possibilities of sound, so they are often very technical and experimental.

Ryoji Ikeda himself is a great god in the field of experimental electronic music
in Japan. He made the expression and concept of electronic music. Also, he has a
wide range of thinking dimensions, and his creative methods are entirely rational and
complex. Many of his works are related to mathematical concepts of quantum
mechanics. Through computer algorithms, he outputs images, superimposition, and
recombination of sound, vision, physical phenomena, mathematical concepts,
human behavior, and contingency in a single performance.
"I think I do not like the word called understand." "I think ART is to feel," said Ryoji
Ikeda.

Here is another German new media artist, Julien Rosefeldt, whose exhibition
"the manifesto" in Mordor last year was very topical. The word "declaration" found
the great devil cate Blanchett to perform 13 scenes, and then with a single large
screen in the same space, very shocking.
In 13 scenes set by the artist, cate Blanchett performs 13 different and contrasting
characters. Based on more than 50 artists' manifestos, Julien Rosefeldt has
designed 13 highly dramatic monologues in the Manifesto, which raises the eternal
question of "the place of artists in society." This work refers to the declarations of the
masters of the modern art movement, which transcending dadaism, surrealism and
minimalism, and reviewing more than 100 years of the art movement. The
declaration individually, the artist is good at the film splicing technology and
montage, into their imaging device, usually, with multiple screen projection, the
mutual influence between image and image overlap, to make a reality.
Speaking of the public environment, it is also the exhibition area of many new
media arts. One of my favorites is Jaume Plensa's famous "crown fountain" in
Chicago's millennium park. Chicago is really an artistic city. In addition to the famous
Anish Kapoor egg, the millennium park also has this electronic fountain. Jaume
Plensa collected images of the faces of Chicago residents and displayed them on
two large electronic screens. Sometimes the faces smiled, sometimes they spat
water out, and then the real water flowed from the screens. As for the production
process of this video, he would ask the subject to blow out a candle seriously in
order to have a perfect pout image
